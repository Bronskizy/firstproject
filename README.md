Linux Distributions
Each Linux distribution consists of a Linux kernel plus utilities and configuration
files. Most Linux distributions can be downloaded from their websites.
Let’s take a look at how several of the popular Linux distributions, or flavours, differ
from each other based on the following criteria:
- Availability
As previously mentioned, Linux is a free software but companies
offering a support contract and proprietary components offer it for a fee.
In the table below, Red Hat Enterprise and SUSE Enterprise both offer
Linux commercially but they also have the free alternatives – Fedora and
openSUSE.
- Package Format
Linux distributions come in packages. Packages are files grouped into
one single file. RPM is the most commonly used.
- Release Cycle
This is how often a distribution releases new software. The ones with
shorter release cycles provide the latest software in the shortest possible
length of time while those distributions with longer release cycles aim to
offer the most stable environments possible. A distribution can have it
done both ways. Take a look at Ubuntu who releases both long-term
support (LTS) versions (longer cycle) and the latest software through a
6month cycle.
